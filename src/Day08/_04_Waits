What have we used so far for wait?
- Thread.sleep()
-> It is a Java method (Not Selenium method).
-> It stops the code execution for the specified amount of time no matter what.
-> Thread.sleep(5000) stops the code for 5 seconds. It just waits. There is no conditions.

-> Never use it in your final code. Because it makes your test execution longer. Don't tell anyone that you use it to make your code wait.

Waits in Selenium

1) Page Load TimeOut

    driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(15));

   It waits until your computer downloads all necessary files(HTML, Styling, Java Script code...) from the server.
   If they are not downloaded in time, Selenium throws TimeOutException.
   That means there is a problem with the server side or your internet connection

2) Implicitly Wait

    driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(15));

    It waits until your browser gets all the downloaded files and converts them into HTML codes.
    It waits for all elements on the page
    If the browser cannot convert them in specified amount of time Selenium throws TimeOutException.
    That means your code is not compatible with that browser

3) Explicitly Wait

    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,Duration.ofSeconds(15));
    wait.until(ExpectedConditions...)

    It stops the code until a certain condition is met
    Allows us to wait only for one element or for one specific condition is met

    Expected Conditions are...

    titleIs                         --> Waits until the title of the page becomes...
    titleContains                   --> Waits until the contains some keyword
    urlToBe                         --> Waits until the url becomes...
    urlContains                     -->
    visibilityOfElementLocated      --> Waits until the element with the given locator is visible.
    invisibilityOfElementLocated    --> Waits until the element with the given locator is invisible.
    elementToBeClickable            --> Waits until an element becomes clickable
    elementToBeSelected             --> Waits until an element becomes selected
    textToBe                        --> Waits until a text becomes...
    alertIsPresent                  --> Waits until an alert pops up
    visibilityOfAllElements         --> Waits until all elements with same locator are displayed on the page. Mostly used with findElements
    numberOfElementsToBe            --> Waits until number of elements that have the same locator to be a specific number
    numberOfElementsToBeLessThan    --> Waits until number of elements that have the same locator to be less than a specific number
    numberOfElementsToBeMoreThan    --> Waits until number of elements that have the same locator to be more than a specific number
